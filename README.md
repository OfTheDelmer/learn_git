# Learn To code
## Git and GitHub

This is a fresh repository (repo) with only a README.  We'll be using it to accomplish the following.


| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Commit and track your versions of a project. |
| Fork and edit versions of a project. |
| Create a simple GitHub page. |


## Setup A GitHub Account

If you haven't already create a GitHub account.

## Editor

For any project you should have an editor. I recommend downloading and using [Atom](https://atom.io/). Why? It has good out the of the box hints for projects using Git and is popular.

## Download GitHub Desktop

You should begin downloading GitHub desktop.

* [Download Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Open GitHub Desktop and continue through it's setup process.
  * Connect to GitHub using your **Login** and **Password**.
  * Configure Git with your email.
  * Finish up and skip the tutorial.

## Downloading A Repo

Let's download our first project.

### Getting Organized

Before we download or create any project we should create a folder to help us remember where we have them all.

* Make a folder on your **Desktop** for all your future projects.
  * Call it `my_projects`

This will just help us stay organized.

### Downloading

Now that we have a place to put our projects we can download an existing one.

* Go to the [`pizza project`](https://github.com/nyc-learn-to-code/pizza) on GitHub.
*  Click the green `Clone or download` button in the upper right hand corner.
* **Select the Download ZIP**.
* Move the `pizza` folder from your `Downloads` to your `Desktop` folder called `my_projects`.

Remember moving the project from the `Downloads` to your `Desktop/my_projects` folder is just to help you stay organized.

### Opening In GitHub Desktop

Open the `my_projects` folder and locate your `pizza` project. Drag the `pizza` project to your GitHub Desktop application.
